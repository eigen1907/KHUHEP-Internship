# KHUHEP-Internship

Welcome to the **KHUHEP-Internship** repository! This repository is dedicated to the Internship Course for the first semester of 2025 at Kyung Hee University. It serves as a collaborative space where you can learn Python, Machine Learning, and Git & GitHub.

## Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  This repository is designed to help you get hands-on experience with Git and GitHub while working on individual projects and assignments in Python and Machine Learning.

- **Collaboration:**  
  If you're unsure about something or need help, feel free to ask. This is a learning environment, so don't hesitate to seek guidance.

## Reference Materials

To assist you on this journey, here are some recommended resources:

## Directory Structure

- **Individual Projects:**  
  Each student should create a directory with their name.  
  *Example:* `jongwon/`

- **Practice (Python & Machine Learning):**  
  Create directories for each chapter or practice topic.  
  Upload your work with the following naming convention:  
  - For practices: `practiceName-yourName.py` or `practiceName-yourName.ipynb`  

## Getting Started with Git & GitHub

This repository is also intended to help you become familiar with Git and GitHub. As you work through your projects, take the time to learn the basics:
- Cloning repositories
- Making commits and pushing changes
- Creating and merging branches
- Opening pull requests for code reviews

Feel free to experiment and ask questions as you learn. Remember, making mistakes is a valuable part of the learning process!
